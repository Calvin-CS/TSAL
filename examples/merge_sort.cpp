 * \brief Visualization of the bottom-up mergesort algorithm.
 * \details Utilizes the sortData struct and sorts a number of items using the mergesort algorithm.
 * \details Uses lines to represent the items being sorted.
 * \details At the start, the items being sorted are all divided.
 * \details Once items have been sorted in one divided section, then sections are merged and the process repeats itself.
 * \details Different colors represent different sections being sorted.
 * \details Once all items have been sorted and merged, the animation stops and all lines are colored white.

/** @example merge_sort.cpp

 * Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that can be done in parallel. As a result,

 * the pitch of the processed item plus a constant. Each thread has its own base
 * pitch so you can differentiate between them near the end of the sorting process.
 *
 * Parse the parameters\n
 * Create the mixer and oscillators\n
 * Start the merge sort algorithm
 * For each thread:
 * - Process an item in the merge step and set the oscillator pitch accordingly
 * - When complete with job, mute the oscillator
